# PostgreSQL Database Project

This project is designed to set up and manage a PostgreSQL database. It includes scripts for initializing the database, defining schemas, seeding data, and executing queries.

## Project Structure

- `src/migrations/init.sql`: SQL commands to set up the initial database schema and structure.
- `src/schemas/schema.sql`: Defines the database schema, including tables, columns, and relationships.
- `src/seed/seed.sql`: SQL commands to populate the database with initial data for testing or development purposes.
- `src/queries/queries.sql`: Various SQL queries that can be executed against the database.
- `scripts/backup.sh`: Shell script to create a backup of the PostgreSQL database.
- `scripts/restore.sh`: Shell script to restore the PostgreSQL database from a backup.
- `config/db.conf`: Configuration file containing database connection settings.
- `docker-compose.yml`: Defines and runs multi-container Docker applications, including the PostgreSQL service.

## Setup Instructions

1. Ensure you have Docker installed on your machine.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Run `docker-compose up` to start the PostgreSQL service.
5. Use the provided SQL scripts to set up your database.
